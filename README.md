This repository contains the primary code for the manuscript titled "IRERAIES." The manuscript has been submitted to Computers & Geosciences for peer review.

The repository's Segmentation folder contains scripts for environment setup, converting annotation formats from JSON to mask, splitting the dataset into training and validation sets, and training, evaluating, and predicting with semantic segmentation models for seabed image analysis. Begin by running the environment setup script, which installs the necessary dependencies.

The image_enhancement folder includes implementations of the CLAHE, DCP, MIP, NUCE, RoWs, and UCM algorithms. These algorithms are designed to enhance seabed images, improving segmentation accuracy.

The data folder contains 25 seabed images along with their corresponding annotation files.
